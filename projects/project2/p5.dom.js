/*! p5.dom.js v0.3.1 Jan 3, 2017 */
/**
 * <p>The web is much more than just canvas and p5.dom makes it easy to interact
 * with other HTML5 objects, including text, hyperlink, image, input, video,
 * audio, and webcam.</p>
 * <p>There is a set of creation methods, DOM manipulation methods, and
 * an extended p5.Element that supports a range of HTML elements. See the
 * <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Beyond-the-canvas">
 * beyond the canvas tutorial</a> for a full overview of how this addon works.
 *
 * <p>Methods and properties shown in black are part of the p5.js core, items in
 * blue are part of the p5.dom library. You will need to include an extra file
 * in order to access the blue functions. See the
 * <a href="http://p5js.org/libraries/#using-a-library">using a library</a>
 * section for information on how to include this library. p5.dom comes with
 * <a href="http://p5js.org/download">p5 complete</a> or you can download the single file
 * <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmccart/p5.js/master/lib/addons/p5.dom.js">
 * here</a>.</p>
 * <p>See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Beyond-the-canvas">tutorial: beyond the canvas</a>
 * for more info on how to use this libary.</a>
